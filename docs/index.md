# Modus CI/CD

Modus CI/CD is a modern, modular, container-native, Kubernetes-based platform for continuous integration, continuous deployment, and general automation.

It was built from the ground up to support enterprise needs but with simplicity in mind.  It accomplishes this by keeping things very modular and extensible,
so the easy things are easy but the hard things are possible.  The normal usage is the default and works properly out of the box.  You don't have to learn a
new programming language to use or extend Modus CI/CD, because the components that make up the system are containers.

Inspiration for this project comes from DJB's componentized design philosophy, the Concourse and GoCD systems, and many years working around bizarre
technical requirements mandated by corporate overlords.
